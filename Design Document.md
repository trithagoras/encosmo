# Encosmo


## Plot
A friendly spaceship named 'Encosmo' has recently returned from an expedition to Pluto but has been in orbit around Mars for weeks without any contact. You and three other cosmonauts have been sent to board the Encosmo and investigate the radio silence.

After an 8 month journey, your team docks and boards the still-silent Encosmo and quickly notice the geometry is all wrong. You cannot find the exit behind you and the interior is impossibly larger than the exterior would suggest. Battling horrors and aliens, you must find out what happened to the Encosmo and make it out alive.

As you progress through the 10 floor dungeon, you find different crewmates along the way who tell you of their expedition. They tell you that they were mind-controlled and their ship was hijacked from Pluto by an alien race living there.
